For a smother experience, you can run `autoimport` each time you save your file
in your editor.

# Vim

To integrate `autoimport` into Vim, I recommend using the [ale
plugin](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale).

!!! note ""

    If you are new to ALE, check [this
    post](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux/vim/vim_plugins/#ale).

`ale` is configured to run `autoimport` automatically by default.
